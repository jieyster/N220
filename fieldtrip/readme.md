## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

The site would showcase the collection of Inuit whalebone sculptures from the _Voices from the Arctic: Contemporary Inuit Art_ collection. These are various sculptures made by carving into whalebone. Whales played a big part in the Inuit peoples' survival and therefor became deeply embedded in their culture.

### Core Webpages

There would be a main home page that introduces the collection and has a picture of each artifact. There would then be a page for each one that gives more information about the specific piece. I would also add a learn more page that delves into the significance of whales in the Inuit culture.

### Design Choices

The home page images would have a linear gradient applied when hovered over and the credits for the work would appear (artist/date/etc). Under that would be a learn more button that links to that specific artifact's page.
The individual artifact pages would have the artifacts displayed so that the user could rotate it to see each side. The learn more page could have an interactive feature with a diagram of a whale. The user can click on each part of the whale and text would pop up that describes how that particular whale part is used.
